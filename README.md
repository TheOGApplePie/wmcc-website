# Assalamualaikum! 
## Welcome to the wmcc website repository
### This repository contains the source code for the public facing website of [wmcc.ca](https://www.wmcc.ca).
### Some information and some guidelines about this repository:
There is an AI bot that assists in code reviews, however, its reviews are not taken as final decisions. It is extremely important to rely on **human** code reviews as AI while is helpful, is also error prone and humans can provide better context.
If you are submitting a code change, please reference any relavent issues so that it is easy to keep track of issues and mark them as resolved as necessary. In addition to checkboxes, they also provide the reviewer with the proper context.

When you are working on a change, it is important to keep your changes in a separate branch and create a PR to merge into main. Please do not commit to main as it is protected. If you are stuck, please reach out to the community and definitely speak to stakeholders as needed! We're all on the same team In Shaa Allah.

Now to understand the structure of the website:
### Announcements
A section that are messages that are quick and easy to get out to the public. When visible, they are always on the home page. Announcements can have a poster, title, description, maybe a call to action button and if so a call to action caption. Because they are announcemens, they also have an expiry datetime - a point in time from which they are no longer relavent to display.

### Events
A section for planned activites throughout the community. They are displayed in a kind of calendar UI with a details page to better inform the user. Events are there for more long term reminders of activities that the organization is planning. An event has a title, a short description, a poster, a call to action button and caption, as well as a datetime of activity.

### About us 
A static section informing the community of the members of staff behind the organization.

### Contact us
A form portal that allows the community to communicate their feedback with management of the masjid.
